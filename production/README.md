I wanted the website to feel like a file that Google has on me, which is why I kept the styling as minimal as possible.  

    -Do you feel like this works? or is there some styling I should add to further this idea. 
    - I used flexbox to style, but the d3/ chat/ p5 canvas elements are slow to respond or do not resize and I'm not sure how to fix it.
The word cloud shows some common words I use in my search history, and they are clickable links.  
The camera is meant to make the user feel like they are being watched, and the words overlayed are just some private or embarassing things I found in my search history.  
The chatbot is meant to represent the persona that Google has formed of me, which I gathered from which ad categories I was placed in.   

    -I'm still working on the chatbot to be able to respond to a lot of the common responses, but if you could list some simple phrases you typed into the chatbot that did not work, that would be great.
